# atari
python pygame module for aiding the creation of atari 2600 like games with graphics and sound routines.

This is not an emulator.


atari.py is the module. The example program is combat.py.
To try out the example program download atari.py and combat.py into the same folder.

This has been tested on windows and ubuntu using python 2.7

atari.py is used in the example combat.py


from atari import *
 
initialization

pygame loop


This is not an emulator.

command list:

=================

sound(audv, audf, audc, length)

the atari had two channels of audio. This function just has one channel, this is just because I think I'm only going to use one and I'm currently the only user of this module.

Did I mention this is not an emulator
